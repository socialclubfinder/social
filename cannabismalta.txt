The Parliament of Malta recently made history by legalizing recreational cannabis for personal use and possession, marking the EU’s first such move. Individuals over 18 can carry up to 7g, grow four plants per household, and possess up to 50g of dried cannabis. However, cannabis cultivation and purchase are restricted to Cannabis Social Clubs, which distribute up to 7g per day and 50g per month to members. The implementation and regulation of this law fall under the purview of Malta’s new Authority on the Responsible Use of Cannabis.
Key regulations

Several key regulations were introduced along with the legalization of cannabis in Malta to ensure that the balance is maintained between providing access to cannabis for recreational and medicinal purposes while also focusing on public safety and preventing abuse. 

    Home cultivation is allowed, but individuals are restricted to storing a maximum of 50 grams of cannabis at home. 
    Consumption of cannabis in public spaces is prohibited, with designated areas provided for cannabis consumption.
    Selling cannabis without a license is illegal, and strict penalties apply to those caught engaging in illegal sales. 

This makes it clear that while the laws have been relaxed, there are still rules in place to ensure that cannabis is used responsibly.
What Are Cannabis Clubs?

A cannabis social club (CSC) is a non-profit organization that provides a private space for the collective cultivation and shared consumption of cannabis among its registered adult members. 
How do Cannabis Clubs Operate in Malta?

Malta’s cannabis clubs, known as ‘Cannabis Harm Reduction Associations,’ are the sole legal source for purchasing cannabis since Malta’s legalization. They operate under strict guidelines to ensure the purity of the product and must use containers labeled with the ARUC seal. Unlike Amsterdam-style coffeeshops, these clubs are member-only, non-profit organizations, adhering to stringent cultivation and operational regulations to maintain their licenses, which can be revoked if compliance is not upheld.
