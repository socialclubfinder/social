        In Spain, personal possession and cultivation of the plant is largely
        decriminalized; however, regulations can vary between municipalities and
        regional governments. The sale and importation of any quantity of
        cannabis containing THC is a criminal offense, and public consumption may
        also result in a fine. However, Spain is well known for its cannabis
        social clubsâ€”informally regulated membership-based clubs that have sought
        to push the limits of the decriminalization law. There are now over 1,000
        of these establishments, which are particularly popular in several
        regions, including tourism hotspots such as Barcelona. Despite occasional
        crackdowns, they have mostly been tolerated by local law enforcement,
        despite objections from the Central Government.
