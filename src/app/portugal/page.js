        In 2001, Portugal attracted global attention when it decriminalized
        possession of small quantities of all drugs for personal use as part of
        a public health approachâ€”rerouting resources from criminal justice to
        public health services. As it stands, up to 25g of cannabis herb or 5g
        of hashish is decriminalized. Last year the politically-dominant
        Socialist Party announced plans to create a working group for adult-use
        legalization, with almost all parties voicing their support for
        regulation at a subsequent conference.
